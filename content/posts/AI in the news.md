**[Artificial Intelligence in the News: How AI Retools, Rationalizes, and Reshapes Journalism and the Public Arena](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/artificial-intelligence-in-the-news.php)**

A summary of Felix M. Simon's findings that are most likely to apply to the marketing industry as well:

* üèéÔ∏èüí® **AI adoption is an acceleration, not a shift**: it is another step towards tech increasing efficiency and productivity. The biggest gains come from identifying where AI adds value or saves time and making the best use of the remaining "human talent".

* ‚öôÔ∏è **Efficiency is highly workflow dependent**: Successful AI workflows & features have come from: data aggregation and transcription (such as scraping revenue data from earnings call), content recommendation (recommendation engines for further reading articles), predicting intent & revenue (dynamic paywalls using AI led to a 2-10% increase in CVR).

* ‚ùå There is a **hidden cost** to the AI shortcut: "manual transcription allows journalists to develop a sense of the underlying material". Some skillsets can atrophy or won't develop post AI adoption, especially with junior roles. How does the organization make up for this learning gap?

* ‚â† Differentiation matters more than ever: if AI brings the **marginal cost of content production to zero**, the value will need to come from elsewhere (ie uncovering new stories/ audience insights).

* üí∏ "Rent extraction" & **dependence on a few limited actors** : if they don't train their own models, there is a financial risk for larger orgs to be tied to a few players and platform features.

* ü¶æ Wether generative AI is **"intelligent" or not misses the point**: iIt is irrelevant in the context of increasing productivity. If the tool can produce outputs that were "previously perceived to be uniquely human", it can drive value and efficiency in the workplace.
