    <p><em>Disclaimer: this is not financial advice. Multiple studies have demonstrated that stock picking rarely outperforms traditional investment vehicles in the long run.</em></p>
<h1 id="2022-apples-itp-the-end-of-meta">2022: Apple&rsquo;s ITP: the end of Meta?</h1>
<p>09/01/2021 - 379.59 - 11/01/2022 - 94.33
=&gt; 75% drop</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s introduction of Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) significantly impacted Meta&rsquo;s stock price. ITP restricted Meta&rsquo;s ability to track user activity across apps and websites, hindering its capacity for targeted advertising in the short term. In addition to ballooning AI expenses, the decline in ad revenue potential caused Meta&rsquo;s stock to tumble.</p>
<p>However, if you were using Facebook Ads Manager and optimizing campaigns at the time, you probably noticed a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the sales/conversions were still occuring, the Meta tracking pixel just stopped crediting Meta Ads for it.</li>
<li>The Conversion API feature (CAPI) was performing well at closing the attribution gap created by ITP.</li>
<li>Claims of media budget exodus towards other platforms were overblown. There was still ROI on Meta.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="2023-chatgpt-the-google-search-killer">2023: ChatGPT: the Google search killer?</h1>
<p>Apr 1, 2022	140.01 - Mar 1, 2023 90.16
=&gt; 36% drop</p>
<p>When OpenAI released ChatGPT, there was concern that users would stop using the search box as their portal to the web and use the chatbot instead. The jury is still out on AI&rsquo;s long term impact on Search, but what 2023 showed us is that the battle would take while to unfold, a battle in which Google maybe holds one of the most important cards: access to unlimited user data to train its LLM on.</p>
<p>At the time, search engine stats show that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interest for ChatGPT did not lead to significant market share gains for Bing</li>
<li>Google remains the biggest toll booth of the internet with the option to increase floor price in the auction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google might have been caught &ldquo;flat-footed&rdquo; on AI but the release of ChatGPT did not lead to a significant difference in user or advertiser behavior in the short term.</p>
<hr>
<p>What do these two stories have in commun? The market overracted on industry noise when the underlying Meta &amp; Google businesses were still very sound. There are multiple other factors that can affect stock price (buy backs, capex expenditures, fiscal policy) but when the market is punishing #Meta or #Google with little regards for the health &amp; performance of its underlying ad business, there is probably an opportunity to buy the dip.</p>
